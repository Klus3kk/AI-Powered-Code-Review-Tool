# AI-Powered Code Review Tool ü§ñüîç
This project aims to enhance code quality and developer productivity by automating code review tasks using AI.
## Key Features
* **Automated Static Analysis:** Identifies common errors, potential bugs, and style issues.
* **Intelligent Suggestions:** Uses NLP to understand code and suggest improvements.
* **Performance Profiling:** Detects potential bottlenecks and recommends optimizations.

## Technologies
* **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn for building and training models.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:** spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers for code understanding and analysis.
* **Code Analysis Tools:** Static analysis tools like Pylint (for Python), ESLint (for JavaScript), or similar tools for other languages to integrate with.
* **Cloud Infrastructure (Optional):** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure for scalability and deployment.
* **Programming Languages:** Python (commonly used for ML and NLP), JavaScript (for web-based UI if needed).

## Future Goals
* **Customization:** Allow teams to define their own coding standards.
* **Security Analysis:** Identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Scalability:** Optimize for use on large codebases.

## Project Status
**Early stages of development. Actively working on building the core functionality and exploring different AI models.**
